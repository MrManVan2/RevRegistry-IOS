# Email Verification Fix for Mobile Registration

## Issue Description
Users creating accounts on mobile were not being prompted for email verification. The app immediately authenticated users after registration, bypassing the email verification security step.

## Root Cause
The mobile app's `signUp` function in `AuthService.swift` was immediately setting `isAuthenticated = true` and saving the auth token after registration, treating the user as logged in without any email verification step.

## Implemented Fix

### 1. Updated Models (`RevRegistry/Models/Models.swift`)
Added new models to support email verification flow:
- `RegisterResponse`: Response from registration endpoint (no longer immediately returns auth token)
- `VerifyEmailRequest`: Request to verify email with verification code  
- `VerifyEmailResponse`: Response after successful email verification (contains auth token)
- `ResendVerificationRequest`: Request to resend verification code
- `ResendVerificationResponse`: Response for resend request

### 2. Updated AuthService (`RevRegistry/Services/AuthService.swift`)
Modified the authentication flow:
- Added `@Published var isAwaitingVerification` and `registrationEmail` state
- Updated `signUp()` to set verification state instead of immediately authenticating
- Added `verifyEmail()` method to handle email verification with code
- Added `resendVerificationCode()` method for resending verification emails
- Added state management methods for verification flow

### 3. Created EmailVerificationView (`RevRegistry/Views/EmailVerificationView.swift`)
New view that provides:
- Clean UI for entering 6-digit verification code
- Email address display and confirmation
- Resend code functionality with timer
- Error handling and loading states
- Option to use different email address

### 4. Updated LoginView (`RevRegistry/Views/LoginView.swift`)
Enhanced navigation flow:
- Changed from `NavigationView` to `NavigationStack` for iOS 16+ navigation
- Added navigation destination for email verification
- Automatic navigation to verification view when `isAwaitingVerification` is true

## Required Backend Changes

The backend API needs to be updated to support this new flow:

### 1. Update `/auth/register` Endpoint
**Current behavior:** Returns `LoginResponse` with immediate auth token
**New behavior:** Returns `RegisterResponse` with verification message

```json
// OLD Response
{
  "user": { ... },
  "token": "jwt_token"
}

// NEW Response  
{
  "message": "Verification email sent",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "requiresVerification": true
}
```

### 2. Add New Verification Endpoints

#### POST `/auth/verify-email`
Verify email with verification code:
```json
// Request
{
  "email": "user@example.com", 
  "verificationCode": "123456"
}

// Response
{
  "user": { ... },
  "token": "jwt_token",
  "message": "Email verified successfully"
}
```

#### POST `/auth/resend-verification` 
Resend verification code:
```json
// Request
{
  "email": "user@example.com"
}

// Response
{
  "message": "Verification code sent"
}
```

### 3. Update Registration Logic
- Generate 6-digit verification code on registration
- Store code in `VerificationToken` table with expiry (30 minutes recommended)
- Send verification email with code
- Set user's `emailVerified` field only after successful verification
- Don't allow sign-in for unverified users

### 4. Update Sign-In Logic  
Add validation to prevent unverified users from signing in:
```json
// Error response for unverified email
{
  "error": "Email not verified",
  "code": "EMAIL_NOT_VERIFIED", 
  "email": "user@example.com"
}
```

## Security Considerations
- Verification codes should be 6 digits and expire after 30 minutes
- Limit resend attempts (max 3 per hour per email)
- Rate limit verification attempts (max 5 attempts per code)
- Use HTTPS for all verification endpoints
- Log verification attempts for security monitoring

## Testing
1. Register new account on mobile - should show verification screen
2. Enter incorrect verification code - should show error
3. Request resend - should work with timer countdown
4. Verify email successfully - should authenticate user
5. Try to sign in with unverified email - should prompt for verification

## Database Migration
Ensure the existing database schema supports:
- `users.emailVerified` DateTime field
- `VerificationToken` table with proper indexes
- Proper foreign key relationships

This fix ensures proper email verification security while maintaining a smooth user experience on mobile devices.
